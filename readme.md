# UGA Weather Scraper
This program can be used to scrape weather from the [UGA weather website](http://weather.uga.edu/). This process can be automated scrape at set intervals using the Task Scheduler program if on Windows(or whatever the Mac equivalent is). The past and historical data on the weather website does not contain all of the same weather metrics that are available for each location at a given time. Therefore, this program allows for the collection of high resolution weather data.
